**************************************
GENERAL INFORMATION:

The goal of this tutorial is to show the potential and basics of SQF. I'll start by describing how to execute SQF scripts, explaining the basic structures
and loops used in SQF syntax before proceeding to converting SQS to SQF. Don't expect a thorough tutorial on SQF scripts, if you already master
making functions this tutorial may not be written for you. If you already master (to some extend) SQS and want to learn how to use SQF syntax
this may be the ideal tutorial to take a step in the good direction.

In this pack I've included working examples of the basic structures used in SQF (for, forEach, if etc). You can use these to create your own scripts with.
If you find any errors in them, I did test them in the editor though, please let me know. To end with, I want to thank the BIS Wiki staff for the huge
piles of information on it.

Happy reading and scripting!
